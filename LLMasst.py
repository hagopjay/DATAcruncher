"""
This script does several things:

1. `read_file_contents()`: Reads the file from a specified subdirectory
2. `analyze_file_structure()`: Attempts to analyze the file's structure
   - Counts total lines
   - Shows first few lines
   - Tries to detect potential patterns
   - Generates a basic regex (which you'll likely need to refine)
3. `main()`: Coordinates the file reading and analysis

Key points for you to customize:
- Replace `'your_subdirectory_path'` with the actual path to your subdirectory
- Modify the pattern detection in `analyze_file_structure()` based on your specific file's structure
- Adjust the regex generation to match your file's exact format

Recommendations:
1. Run the script and examine the output carefully
2. Manually review the suggested regex and file patterns
3. Refine the regex and pattern detection as needed
